            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I am a sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis studying Cognitive Neuroscience. On campus, I am a part of the Korean Student Association and Campus Y WAGS, a volunteering organization that volunteers at animal shelters. 
                Off campus, I do research for the Gereau Lab at the medical school. This summer, I am a part of the Less Annoying CRM 2019 Coding Fellowship and I will be volunteering at the Humane Society. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I enjoy dancing, trying new restaurants, photography, and reading. I love Marvel movies, especially Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Captain Marvel.
